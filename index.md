## A tale as old as time

Too often, I have a specific issue we need to address and we spend 3 hours scouring Statalist and Stack Overflow to together some makeshift solution. Then without fail, I have a similar issue 6 months later but forgot how to deal with it. My options are

1. Waste 3 more hours again
2. Waste 2 hours finding the code with the solution

#### Waste time no more!


Now I compile all useful tricks I've encountered over the years in a nice searchable location so that I can easily access them in the future.
