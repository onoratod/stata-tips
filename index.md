## A tale as old as time

Too often, I have a specific issue I need to address and I spend 3 hours scouring Statalist and Stack Overflow to put together some makeshift solution. Then without fail, I have a similar issue 6 months later but forgot how to deal with it. My options are

1. Waste 3 more hours again
2. Waste 2 hours finding the code with the solution

#### Waste time no more!

Now I compile all useful tricks I've encountered over the years in a nice searchable location so that I can easily access them in the future.
